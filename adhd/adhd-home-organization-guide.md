# Your Comprehensive ADHD Home Organization Guide
### For When You Want to Do Everything and End Up Doing Nothing

---

## Understanding What's Happening (And Why You're Not Broken)

**The Work vs. Home Paradox**

You're great at multitasking at work because work provides external structure: deadlines, meetings, coworkers expecting things, clear priorities set by others. At home, YOU have to create all that structure, and that's where ADHD brains struggle most.

**The "Want to Do Everything" Trap**

Your brain sees all possibilities at once with equal urgency. It's like having 30 browser tabs open and they're all playing different songs. This isn't a character flaw - it's executive dysfunction, a core ADHD symptom.

---

## Part 1: The Foundation - Your New Operating System

### Rule #1: You Can Only Do ONE Thing Right Now

This is the most important concept. Not one category. Not one area. ONE specific task.

**Why this works:** Your ADHD brain needs clear, singular focus. Decision-making and task-switching drain your executive function faster than actually doing tasks.

### Rule #2: "Future You" Doesn't Exist

Stop planning for the motivated person you'll be tomorrow. Plan for the tired, distracted person you actually are.

**Why this works:** ADHD makes time perception difficult. We overestimate future motivation and underestimate how long things take.

### Rule #3: Make It Stupidly Easy

If a system requires willpower or "just remembering," it will fail. Your environment must do the remembering for you.

**Why this works:** Working memory deficits mean you can't rely on remembering to do things. External cues are essential.

---

## Part 2: The Immediate Action Plan (Start Today)

### Step 1: The Brain Dump (15 minutes)

Right now, take out your phone or a piece of paper and list every single thing bouncing around in your head that you "want to do" or "should do" at home.

Don't organize it. Don't prioritize it. Just dump it all out.

This clears mental RAM and stops the "don't forget, don't forget, don't forget" loop.

### Step 2: The Brutal Edit (10 minutes)

Go through your list and put a star next to only the things that:
- Have actual deadlines or consequences
- Are actively bothering you when you see them (dirty dishes, pile of mail)
- Would take less than 5 minutes

Everything else gets moved to a "Someday/Maybe" list that you don't look at for now.

**Key insight:** You're not abandoning those ideas. You're protecting yourself from decision paralysis.

### Step 3: Choose Your ONE Thing for Today (2 minutes)

From your starred items, pick literally one. Not the most important one. Not the hardest one. Pick whichever one you feel even 10% motivated to do right now.

Write it on a sticky note and put it somewhere you'll see it.

---

## Part 3: The Daily System (Your New Routine)

### Morning: The Launch Sequence (10 minutes)

**When:** Right after your Vyvanse kicks in (usually 30-60 minutes after taking it)

1. Check your calendar for any time-based commitments today
2. Look at your "Today" list (maximum 3 items)
3. Choose your ONE thing to start with
4. Set a timer for 15 minutes and begin

**Why this works:** Vyvanse is most effective in the first few hours. Use this window for your most important or most dreaded task.

### The "Just Start" Technique

You don't have to finish the task. You just have to start for 15 minutes.

After 15 minutes:
- If you want to continue, great! Keep going.
- If not, stop guilt-free. You did what you committed to.

**Why this works:** Starting is the hardest part for ADHD brains. Making the commitment tiny removes the mental barrier.

### Afternoon: The Transition Moment (5 minutes)

**When:** When you get home from work

This is your most vulnerable time - you've used up executive function at work, and now you're facing an unstructured evening.

**Your new rule:** Before you sit down, before you check your phone, do ONE 5-minute task.

Examples:
- Put mail in its designated spot
- Load/unload dishwasher
- Lay out tomorrow's clothes
- Take out trash
- Wipe down bathroom sink

**Why this works:** It creates momentum before you lose all energy. It proves to your brain that home tasks are possible.

### Evening: The Wind-Down (5 minutes)

**When:** Before bed or when you're clearly done being productive

1. Write down 1-3 things for tomorrow
2. Do a 2-minute reset of one space (kitchen counter, coffee table, bathroom)
3. Set up your morning (keys, bag, medications visible)

**Why this works:** Reduces morning decision-making and creates closure for your brain.

---

## Part 4: Organizing Your Physical Space

### The ADHD-Friendly Space Principles

**Visible Storage > Hidden Storage**

If it's out of sight, it doesn't exist to your ADHD brain.

- Use open shelving, clear containers, pegboards
- Keep frequently used items in plain view
- Label everything, even if it seems obvious

**One Home for Everything**

Every object needs exactly one designated spot. Not "kitchen drawer somewhere" but "second drawer down, left side."

**The Launching Pad**

Create one designated spot near your door for keys, wallet, phone, bag - whatever you need to leave the house. This spot is sacred.

**Task Stations**

Group items by task, not by category:
- "Bill paying station": envelopes, stamps, calculator, pens
- "Morning routine station": vitamins, meds, water bottle
- "Leaving the house station": keys, sunglasses, reusable bags

### The Critical Zones

**Zone 1: Surfaces (counters, tables, floors)**

These are "landing pads" where everything accumulates. Your goal isn't to keep them clear - it's to reset them once a day.

Pick one surface. Each evening, spend 2 minutes returning items to their homes.

**Zone 2: The Kitchen**

Most ADHD-friendly rule: Don't let dishes sit overnight.

- Load dishwasher right after dinner (or while food is cooking)
- If no dishwasher: wash, rinse, leave in drying rack
- Future you will thank you every single morning

**Zone 3: The Bedroom**

Your bedroom should promote sleep, not remind you of tasks.

- Laundry basket in an obvious spot
- "Floordrobe" is real - put hooks on the wall for "worn but not dirty" clothes
- Keep one clear chair or space that's always clear for tomorrow's outfit

---

## Part 5: The Task Management System

### The Three-List Method

You need exactly three lists. Not ten. Three.

**List 1: Today (Maximum 3 items)**

This is sacred. These are the only things you're attempting today. If you add a fourth item, remove one first.

**List 2: This Week (Maximum 10 items)**

Things that need to happen in the next 7 days. Review this list each morning to populate "Today."

**List 3: Someday/Maybe (Unlimited)**

Everything else. All those ideas and projects and things you might want to do. You look at this monthly, not daily.

### Where to Keep These Lists

**Option A: Phone Note App (Best for most people)**

- Simple, always with you
- Use separate notes for each list
- Pin "Today" note to the top

**Option B: Physical Sticky Notes**

- Today list: Sticky note on bathroom mirror
- This Week: Sticky note on fridge
- Someday/Maybe: Notebook in a drawer

**Option C: Simple App**

Todoist, TickTick, or Microsoft To Do (free versions) work well because they allow task capture without overwhelming features.

**The rule:** Pick ONE system and use only that system for 30 days before changing.

### Breaking Down Overwhelming Tasks

When a task feels impossible to start, it's too big.

**Big task:** Clean the garage  
**Broken down:** Fill one trash bag from the garage

**Big task:** Organize finances  
**Broken down:** Log into bank account and look at balance

**Big task:** Get in shape  
**Broken down:** Put on workout clothes

You can always do more, but you only commit to the tiny version.

---

## Part 6: Managing the "Want to Do Everything" Feeling

### When the Overwhelm Hits

You're sitting at home. Your brain is screaming about 15 different things. Here's your protocol:

**Step 1: Name it**

Say out loud or write down: "I'm experiencing task paralysis right now."

**Step 2: Body reset**

Stand up. Drink water. Take five deep breaths. Splash cold water on your face.

**Step 3: The question**

Ask yourself: "What's the ONE thing that, if I did it in the next 15 minutes, would make me feel slightly better?"

Not productive. Not important. Just slightly better.

**Step 4: Do that thing**

Set a timer. Do it. Nothing else matters.

### The "Shiny New Project" Trap

You get excited about a new idea. You want to start immediately. This is your brain giving you a dopamine hit.

**Your new rule:** Write it down in your Someday/Maybe list. Tell yourself you can start it next week.

90% of the time, the urgency fades. 10% of the time, it's still interesting next week - and then you can actually start it.

---

## Part 7: Working With Your Medication

### Understanding Vyvanse's Window

Vyvanse typically provides 10-14 hours of coverage. You have a golden window when it's most effective.

**Your medication strategy:**

- Take Vyvanse at the same time every day (set a phone alarm)
- Schedule your most challenging home task during peak hours (usually 2-6 hours after taking it)
- Accept that evening you might be tired - plan easier tasks then
- Don't try to "power through" when medication is wearing off

### What Medication Does (And Doesn't Do)

**Vyvanse helps with:**
- Sustaining focus on boring tasks
- Reducing impulsivity
- Improving working memory slightly
- Following through on plans

**Vyvanse doesn't:**
- Make you organized automatically
- Create systems for you
- Eliminate the need for strategies
- Fix time blindness completely

Think of medication as clearing fog from your windshield. You still need to drive the car.

### Tracking What Works

For the first month, keep simple notes:

- What time did I take medication?
- What time did I feel most focused?
- What tasks felt easier vs. harder?
- Any side effects?

This helps you and your doctor optimize your treatment.

## Part 8: Habit Building for ADHD Brains

### Forget Motivation. Build Tiny Habits.

Traditional advice: "Just make it a habit! Do it for 30 days!"

ADHD reality: We need different rules.

### The Habit Recipe

**After I [existing behavior], I will [new tiny behavior].**

Examples:
- After I pour my coffee, I will take my vitamins
- After I sit down at home, I will hang up my coat
- After I brush my teeth, I will put tomorrow's clothes out
- After I plug in my phone to charge, I will write down one task for tomorrow

**Why this works:** You're not relying on memory or motivation. You're piggybacking on something you already do automatically.

### The Two-Minute Rule

If it takes less than two minutes, do it now. Not later. Now.

This prevents the accumulation of tiny tasks that become overwhelming mountains.

Examples: Hanging up coat, throwing away mail you don't need, putting dishes in dishwasher, replying to a simple text.

### Never Miss Twice

You'll miss days. You'll have bad weeks. This is guaranteed.

**The rule:** Never miss twice in a row.

Missed your evening reset yesterday? Do it today. Even if it's half-assed. Even if it's 30 seconds.

This prevents the shame spiral that destroys habits.

---

## Part 9: Environmental Modifications

### Remove Friction from Good Behaviors

**Laundry example:**

Traditional: Hamper in closet → Carry to laundry room → Sort → Wash → Dry → Fold → Put away

ADHD-friendly: Hamper near laundry room → Don't sort, just wash → Hang dry or leave in basket → Wear from basket is fine

**Meal prep example:**

Traditional: Plan 7 dinners → Shop for specific ingredients → Cook from scratch

ADHD-friendly: Keep 3 easy meals always in stock → Shop for these only → Accept that this is fine

### Add Friction to Bad Behaviors

Put your phone in another room when you get home. Keep TV remote in a drawer. Make the default choice the healthy one.

### Visual Cues Everywhere

- Toothbrush on the counter (not in drawer)
- Vitamins next to coffee maker
- Reusable water bottle on your desk
- Dog leash on door handle
- Bills to pay in front of your laptop

If you need to remember it, it needs to be visible.

---

## Part 10: The Weekly Review (15 minutes)

### When: Pick the Same Day/Time Each Week

Friday evening or Sunday morning work well.

### What to Do:

1. **Brain dump:** What's been on your mind this week?
2. **Review Someday/Maybe:** Anything ready to move to "This Week"?
3. **Plan next week:** What are 3-5 things you want to accomplish at home?
4. **Reset one space:** Pick one area (closet, desk, car) and spend 10 minutes resetting it
5. **Celebrate:** Name one thing you actually did this week, even if small

**Why this works:** Prevents the buildup of mental clutter and gives you a regular check-in point.

---

## Part 11: When You Mess Up (And You Will)

### The ADHD Reality Check

You will:
- Forget things
- Get overwhelmed
- Have days where nothing gets done
- Abandon systems that aren't working
- Feel like you're failing

**This is not failure. This is having ADHD.**

### The Reset Protocol

**When things fall apart:**

1. Lower your standards even further
2. Pick ONE thing from this guide to restart
3. Do a complete brain dump
4. Tell someone (friend, therapist, online community) what's happening

**You don't have to restart everything at once.** Just pick one strategy from this guide and begin again.

### Self-Compassion Script

When you're beating yourself up, say this:

"I have a neurodevelopmental disorder that affects executive function. I'm not lazy. I'm not broken. I'm working with a brain that processes tasks differently. I'm doing the best I can with the brain I have, and I'm building systems to help me succeed."
